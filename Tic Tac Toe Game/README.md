I have tried to create a Tic Tac Toe game (3x3) with a local 1v1 game mode and an advance computer game mode.
Local 1v1 game mode lets two local players play the game
The computer gamemode is created by advance logic which lets player play against that computer logic
This project is created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. 
(Used only my skills as a beginner, so the code may contain some flaws)
